Create a Singly Linked List of the stocks owned by a person.

1. Create a Stock class

2. The class should store a stock symbol (like AAPL, GOOG), the price of each stock and the number of stocks owned.

3. Use "has-a" implementation for the node.

4. Load some initial stocks from a file.

5. The program should allow a user to insert, delete, display_all stocks

6. Write a function to find the middle of the linked list. (Try to do it in just one pass).

Create your stack implementation just like the way provided by STL.

> 1. Your implementation should at least provide the following functions - pop, push, size, empty.

> 2. Your implementation should not put any restrictions on the size the stack can grow.  (only system memory restrictions which will obviously be there)

> 3. Use templates so that this implementation can be used for any object type.

> 4. Remember to design your solution by considering the object-oriented design principles.

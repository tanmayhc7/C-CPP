Create a clockType class with hr, min, sec as private members.  
> You should write the program divided into three parts -  clock.h clock.cpp and lab1main.cpp lab1main.cpp will have the main function and should support the following statements:
 
clockType c1(15, 45, 30), c2(3, 20);  // hour, min, sec
cout << c1;   // add whatever to beautify it
cout << c2;
cout << c1+c2;
c2 = c1+c1;
cout << c2;
